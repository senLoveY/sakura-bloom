# 🌸 Sakura Bloom Analysis Project

This project investigates the phenology of cherry blossom flowering in Japan, with interconnected objectives:

* **Analyze long-term bloom trends** — Study how climate variability affects the timing of first and full bloom across Japan.
* **Assess tourism impact** — Explore how bloom timing influences visitor patterns and regional tourism dynamics.
* **Optimize travel routes** — Design an itinerary planner to help travelers experience multiple bloom events during a single trip.

The project combines historical phenological data, climate records, and geospatial analysis to deliver both scientific insights and practical tools.
